# Data_Warehousing_Final_Project  
 This is the final code for performing sentiment analysis on Restaurant review data set which was taken from Kaggle.com  
 [Data Source-Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset#yelp_academic_dataset_review.json)  
 The file is ipython notebook file which can be opened in jupyter notebook.  
 The abrevations used in the code are-    
 negScore-Negative Score    
 posScore-Positive Score    
 netScore-Neutral score    
 avgScore-Compound score    
 starsp-Star Polarity( 1&2=1, 3=2, 4&5=3)
